# CalculatorDevops
Miniproject for calculator

The calculator application is a small project that is developed for better
understanding of source control management, continuous integration and
deployment. The cycle includes creating a small calculator that has functions like
square root, natural log, power and factorial.
The cycle would include pushing latest changes to git (GitHub), building code using
maven, pushing build docker image onto docker hub. This entire process is called
continuous integration.
Later we will integrate Ansible with Jenkins which will support continuous
deployment.


Added webhook for automation.
